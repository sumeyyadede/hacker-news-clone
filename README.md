# hacker-news-clone

This is my first project with React and I made a Hacker News Clone. There are some bugs so I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.

### Prerequisites

You should install npm package manager. <br/>
You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

### Running Locally

> git clone git@github.com:sumeyyadede/hacker-news-clone.git <br/>
> cd hacker-news-clone <br/>
> npm install <br/>
> npm start 

### API Reference

I used the APIs from https://github.com/HackerNews/API
