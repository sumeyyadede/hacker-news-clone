# hacker-news-clone

This is my first project with React and I made a Hacker News Clone. There are some bugs so I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.


### Prerequisites

You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

### API Reference
I used the APIs from https://github.com/HackerNews/API
